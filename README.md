# ü§ñ AI Chatbot with NLP using spaCy and Wikipedia

This project is developed as part of the **CODTECH Internship Task-3**. It is an intelligent, interactive AI chatbot that utilizes **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Wikipedia** to provide informative responses. Built with Python and Streamlit, the chatbot can interact with users through text or voice input, analyze queries using spaCy, retrieve relevant information from Wikipedia, and even read responses aloud using text-to-speech.

## üìå Project Objective

The primary goal of this task is to build an **AI chatbot** that:
- Understands user input using **NLP techniques** (via spaCy)
- Extracts meaningful keywords from the text
- Searches for relevant information using the **Wikipedia API**
- Responds either via text display or **text-to-speech**
- Optionally takes input via microphone
- Provides a **user-friendly GUI** using Streamlit

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `Python` | Core programming language |
| `spaCy` | NLP processing and keyword extraction |
| `wikipedia` | Wikipedia API for fetching content |
| `SpeechRecognition` | Accepting voice commands |
| `pyttsx3` | Text-to-speech (TTS) for responses |
| `Streamlit` | For creating an interactive web-based GUI |
| `VS Code` | Editor platform used for development |
| `Anaconda` | For managing Python environments and packages |

## üß† How It Works

1. **User Input**: User types a question or speaks using a microphone (optional).
2. **NLP with spaCy**: The chatbot processes the input using spaCy to identify important keywords (entities/nouns).
3. **Wikipedia Search**: It uses the top keyword to search Wikipedia and retrieve the most relevant summary.
4. **Response Output**:
   - Text response is displayed in the GUI.
   - Optionally, the chatbot reads the answer aloud using `pyttsx3`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Used

- Developed using **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
- Environment managed using **Anaconda** and virtual environments
- GUI deployed via **Streamlit**, allowing easy web-based interaction
